## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Local storage
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This was my first React project that I've completed, so I definitely learned a lot. I got a lot of practice with components, props, state, event listeners, and how forms work. I look forward to learning more complex React concepts and applying them to future projects.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about the different React hooks in the future. I was able to incorporate the useEffect() hook in this project, but even then I am still a little confused on its actual purpose and true potential.

### Useful resources

- [FCC React Beginner Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=36252s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) - I essentially used everything I learned in this video to build this app, so I recommend checking it out if you're looking to take your first dive into React!
- [Create a Persisting Dark Mode with React](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/create-a-persisting-dark-mode-with-react/) - I used this blog post to help me implement the persisting light/dark mode functionality.
